## What is Dynamic Programming
Dynamic programming is both a mathematical optimization method and an algorithmic paradigm. 
The method was developed by Richard Bellman in the 1950s and has found applications in numerous fields,
such as aerospace engineering and economics. 

> The name is misleading and Richard Bellman named this optimization method as _dynamic programming_ because in 1950s he worked at RAND corporation which was employed by the Air Force. The Air Force had Wilson as its boss who had pathological fear and hatred for the word research. Bellman chose "dynamic programming" because the method is dynamic - changes with every problem and programming was added to just make it not sound like a research method
