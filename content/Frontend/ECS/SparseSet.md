# Sparse set

They make it possible to iterate all contained elements as a tightly packed and contiguous array and so it’s O(N).
Adding and removing elements is $\int{O(1)}$ as well as lookup operation.
Sorting is possible and the cost mostly depends on the chosen approach (I’ve already written a post on this, so I won’t repeat myself).
