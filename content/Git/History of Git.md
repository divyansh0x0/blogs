(1991 - 2002), changes to software was passed around as patches and archived files. Then in 2002, the Linux kernel project began using a proprietary DVCS called BitKeeper.

But in 2005, the relationship between the community that developed Linux kernel and Bitkeeper broke down and tool's free of charge status was revoked.

This prompted the community (particularly *Linux Trovalds*, the creator of Linux) to develop there own tool which had features from BitKeeper. These were 
1. Speed
2. Simplicity
3. Strong support for parallel development.
4. Fully distributed (no centralization of code)
5. Ability to handle large projects with speed and efficient data size.

Git came into existence in 2005, abd gas evolved into an easy to use VCS. Its extremely fast, very efficient with large project and has incredible branching system.
